### About

I build and study machine learning models with attention to both their performance and their robustness.  
My work often involves connecting structured data with interpretability and real-world constraints.  

Areas of interest:
- Deep learning applied to tabular and time-series data  
- Retrieval and graph-based methods for knowledge representation  
- Evaluation and reliability of AI models  
- Applications in energy systems, environmental data, and industrial processes
